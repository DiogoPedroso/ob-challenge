Description: This is my (Diogo Pedroso) proposed solution for the issued code challenge.

This project requires an installation of Node js to run and a MongoDB installation on a local machine.

To get the modules necessary to run this project, open a terminal console in the root directory of this project and run:
npm -i

To start the project, run the following command:
node index.js

To run the test suite use the following command:
npm run test

For the testing of the API it is recommended to use POSTMAN API (https://www.getpostman.com/), which is what was used during the development of the API.

The "examples of HTTP calls" folder contains a few examples of calls that can be made to the API for testing purposes based on the given files and exercise sheet instructions. The values can and should be changed but the structure should remain the same.

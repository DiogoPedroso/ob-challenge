Description: This is my (Diogo Pedroso) proposed solution for the issued code challenge.

This project requires an installation of Node js to run and a MongoDB installation on a local machine.

To get the modules necessary to run this project, open a terminal console in the root directory of this project and run:
npm -i

To start the project, run the following command:
node index.js

To run the test suite use the following command:
npm run test

For the testing of the API it is recommended to use POSTMAN API (https://www.getpostman.com/), which is what was used during the development of the API.
